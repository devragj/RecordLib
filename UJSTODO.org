* TODOS for UJS Searching

TODO The Process Selected Documents button will send 
a) the selected documents to a server endpoint, ujs/download

b) the server then creates db objects for these documents, and downloads them, and responds with ids for these downloaded documents.

c) redux has a slice called 'recordDocuments' that is a bunch of the documents from the server.

4) upload documents also uploads docs to the server and responds with a bunch of documents that are stored in the recordDocuments slice.

5) a different endpoint gets a set of recordDocuments as well as the current CRecord, and 
updates the current CRecord with the results from analyzing the recordDocuments.

TODO when generating petitions, the client sends the list of documents. 
The server includes these documents in the petition package
